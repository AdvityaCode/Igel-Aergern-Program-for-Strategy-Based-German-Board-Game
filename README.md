# Project Title
Object Oriented software in Python and Java for users to play Igel Aergern, a German strategy based board game. The game involves moving tokens forward and sideways till 3 tokens of 1 color reach the goal columns. The board has traps that prevent movement and distinct rules for valid movement. The game allows for computer and human players in both the Java and Python implementations. However, this repository is the java implemenation.

## File Descriptions 
- Board is the abstract data type that is defined to create the board structure.
- Cell is another data type defined as a list of lists (Cell[][])
- Driver is used to run the game. If you wish to play the game, use Driver!
- IgelView depicts the board on the stdout.
- IgelAergen contains the logic of the game.
- Player actually defines each color token that each represent a different player
- Die is the die roll used to play the game.
- Psueduocode shows some of my initial thinking for how to implement the logic of the game.
