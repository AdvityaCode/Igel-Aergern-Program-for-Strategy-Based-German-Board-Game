with full academic honesty. [Advitya Singh] 

Psuedocode in English explain what mainPhase will do and how.

Implementation for mainPhase IGNORING THE SIDEWAYS MOVE.
    While the checkWinner() function of IgelAergern is equal to null, give the first player a turn.
        Roll die.
        Ask user which column they want to move token forward in. 
        Move that token forward.

How I will use methods of board in mainphase:
- toString() will be used repeatedly to display the board the igelView
- moveFoward from mainPhase itself does all the work of moving the tokens forward, it will just called in mainPhase()
- Similarly, moveSideways() will perform all of the sideways movement on the board
- isActiveTrap will make sure user is not trying to move token from a trap cell
- checkWinner will use countTokensInColumn to count the number of token in the 9th column

Pseudcode for checkWinner() in IgelAergen:

    Define a string that holds the string version of the 9th column of every row.
    Create a counter for every token in the board. 
    Put all of these counters in a ArrayList. 
    Create a for loop that iterates through this list. 
    Add 1 to the counter for every token the for loop sees. 

    Create a foor loop that iterates through the ArrayList of counters.
    If any element of arrayList is greater than 3, return true.
    Else, return false. 

Pseudcode for moving sideways in IgelAergen:

Tell the user that if they want to move sideways, enter row number from which they want to move sideways. Else enter 0. 
If they say a row number, ask which column from that row they want to move top token from.
Next, ask if they would like to move this token up or down.
Use sidewaysMove() function from board to perform the sideways move. 
Use the isActiveTrap function from board class to make sure user is not trying to move token from a trap cell.
